	<div class="Lyrics">
	<p>I like being independent<br>
	Not so much of an investment<br>
	No one to tell me what to do<br>
	I like being by myself<br>
	Don't gotta entertain anybody else<br>
	No one to answer to</p>

	<p>But sometimes, I just want somebody to hold<br>
	Someone to give me the jacket when it's cold<br>
	Got that young love even when we're old<br>
	Yeah, sometimes, I want someone to grab my hand<br>
	Pick me up, pull me close, be my man<br>
	I will love you till the end</p>

	<p>So if you're out there, I swear to be good to you<br>
	But I'm done lookin' for my future someone<br>
	'Cause when the time is right<br>
	You'll be here, but for now<br>
	Dear no one, this is your love song<br>
	Ooh oh oh</p>

	<p class="Decor1">I don't really like big crowds<br>
	I tend to shut people out<br>
	I like my space, yeah<br>
	But I'd love to have a soul mate<br>
	And God'll give him to me someday<br>
	And I know it'll be worth the wait</p>

	<p class="Decor2">So if you're out there, I swear to be good to you<br>
	But I'm done lookin' for my future someone<br>
	'Cause when the time is right<br>
	You'll be here, but for now<br>
	Dear no one (Dear nobody), this is your love song<br>
	Ooh ooh ooh oh</p>

	<p>Sometimes, I just want somebody to hold<br>
	Someone to give me their jacket when it' cold<br>
	Got that young love even when we're old<br>
	Yeah, sometimes, I want someone to grab my hand<br>
	Pick me up, pull me close, be my man<br>
	I will love you till the end</p>

	<p>So if you're out there, I swear to be good to you<br>
	But I'm done lookin' for my future someone<br>
	'Cause when the time is right<br>
	You'll be here, but for now<br>
	Dear no one, (Dear nobody) this is your love song</p>

	<p>Dear no one<br>
	No need to be searching, no<br>
	Dear no one<br>
	Ooo-ooo-ooh<br>
	Dear no one, oh-oh-o-oooh<br>
	Dear no one<br>
	This is your love song</p>
